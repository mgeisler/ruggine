OysterPack Rust workspace ('ruggine' is the Italian word for 'rust')

# Vision
The vision is to provide a Rust platform that empowers developers and organizations to adopt rust.

## Why Rust ?
Because Rust provides the following competitive advantages:

1. Memory safety
2. Memory efficiency, i.e.,small memory footprint
3. Performance
   - CPU efficiency
   - No garbage collector
   - Zero-cost abstractions
   - Async futures
   - Async IO 
4. Fearless concurrency
   - thanks to memory safety and borrowing/ownership model enforced at compile time 
5. Single binary deployment
   - small binaries
6. First class tooling, i.e., cargo
7. Excellent documentation
8. Open source language - empowering the community 

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is simply the best systems programming language that we can **TRUST** for building production grade systems.
Rust's focus on **safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency** delivers the performance and control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language.

The bottom line is that Rust will:
1. reduce operational costs thanks to low memory footprint, small binaries, and high performance 
2. enhance customer experiences thanks to enhanced performance, reliability, and stability
3. strengthen developers thanks to the rust compiler
4. prevent entire classes of bugs thanks to the rust compiler
5. boost developer productivity thanks to rust first class support for tooling and documentation
